## **Problem Statement**

You are a manager or analyst at a medium-sized company. You have noticed a drop in performance from the team. You investigate the causes and find that absenteeism is quite a problem. You need to determine how to help those who are missing work. 

You are provided with a Human Resources Absenteeism dataset. You are required to use this dataset and build a Power BI dashboard. This dashboard will then be used to gather insights and answer questions regarding employee absenteeism.

## **Key Tasks and Accomplishments:**

I investigated and analyzed absenteeism trends in a medium-sized company and presented findings and recommendations to stakeholders. The followin tasks was carried out:

- I conducted data cleaning, transformation, and analysis on the Human Resources Absenteeism dataset using Power-Query and DAX.

- I developed a 2 page Power BI dashboard that effectively visualizes and communicates absenteeism trends and insights to stakeholders.


**Overall, this project demonstrated my ability to leverage data analytics tools and techniques to identify key insights and drive meaningful improvements in organizational performance.**

## **Here is what the dashboard looks like:**
